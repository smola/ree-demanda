ree-demanda
===========

Utilities to extract Spanish power generation statistics from [demanda.ree.es](http://demanda.ree.es/demanda.html). REE's service exposes a visualization of power generation statistics, as well as demand forecasts.

REE's Flash visualizer is backed by a SOAP web service providing detailing statistics. However, the web service is not publicly documented. In fact, it features a clumsy mechanism to prevent access.

This projects aims to provide basic reference utilities to extract and manipulate REE's web service.
